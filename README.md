# Welcome!

Here is my site.
Visit [the site](https://elijah629.github.io) to see it.

# Search:
If the search bar wont popup on the home page its still loading
The steps in loading it are:
1. Run the lunr.js indexbuilder i made that loads the sitemap of my website (this)
2. Setup all the search functions
3. check if the q parameter exists and is not empty
4. if so delete the page data and replace with result page
5. else load the normal home page
6. then load the search bar dynamicly
So its alot of steps and step 1 is the logest the bigger my site is (it acts as a website crawler when crawling the entire web would take years THIS only takes minuits (once ran on one computer that browser session will load it faster because its in the cache) )
